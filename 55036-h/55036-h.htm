<h2 class="lsp2">PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="r20" />

<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object than a full display of the noble
deeds with which the Military History of our country
abounds. To hold forth these bright examples to
the imitation of the youthful soldier, and thus to
incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct of those
who have preceded him in their honorable career,
are among the motives that have given rise to the
present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the "London Gazette," from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders,
and the Officers and Troops acting under
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks
for their skill and bravery; and these testimonials,
confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign's
approbation, constitute the reward which the soldier
most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command
that every Regiment shall, in future, keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
long a period, being undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on
their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable life,
by which so many national benefits are obtained and
preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to
the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services and of acts of individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under his Majesty's special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant
General's Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment to everything belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great, the valiant, the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood
"firm as the rocks of their native shore:" and when
half the world has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen, our brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
our fellow citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant
deeds before us, will certainly prove acceptable to
the public.</p>

<p>Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed, the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<p class="noindent">The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been
celebrated for innate courage and unshaken firmness,
and the national superiority of the British troops
over those of other countries has been evinced in
the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery,
that no doubts can be raised upon the facts which
are recorded. It must therefore be admitted, that
the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
<span class="smcap">Intrepidity</span>. This quality was evinced by the
inhabitants of England when their country was
invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army, on
which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into
the sea to attack the Roman soldiers as they descended
from their ships; and, although their discipline
and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing
intimidated the flower of the Roman troops, including
Cæsar's favourite tenth legion. Their arms
consisted of spears, short swords, and other weapons
of rude construction. They had chariots, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
axles of which were fastened sharp pieces of iron
resembling scythe-blades, and infantry in long
chariots resembling waggons, who alighted and
fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit
or retreat, sprang into the chariot and drove off
with the speed of cavalry. These inventions were,
however, unavailing against Cæsar's legions: in
the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and
British courage, being thus regulated, was exerted
to the greatest advantage; a full development of
the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.</p>

<p>The military force of the Anglo Saxons consisted
principally of infantry: Thanes, and other men of
property, however, fought on horseback. The
infantry were of two classes, heavy and light.
The former carried large shields armed with spikes,
long broad swords and spears; and the latter were
armed with swords or spears only. They had also
men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.</p>

<p>The feudal troops established by William the
Conqueror consisted (as already stated in the Introduction
to the Cavalry) almost entirely of horse;
but when the warlike barons and knights, with their
trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although
these were of inferior degree, they proved stout-hearted
Britons of stanch fidelity. When stipendiary
troops were employed, infantry always constituted
a considerable portion of the military force;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
and this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i> has since acquired, in every quarter
of the globe, a celebrity never exceeded by the
armies of any nation at any period.</p>

<p>The weapons carried by the infantry, during the
several reigns succeeding the Conquest, were bows
and arrows, half-pikes, lances, halberds, various
kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of
time the practice became general for military men
to be so completely cased in steel, that it was
almost impossible to slay them.</p>

<p>The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the
destructive purposes of war, in the early part of the
fourteenth century, produced a change in the arms
and equipment of the infantry-soldier. Bows and
arrows gave place to various kinds of fire-arms, but
British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect
bore of the fire-arms when first introduced,
a body of men, well trained in the use of the bow
from their youth, was considered a valuable acquisition
to every army, even as late as the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth
each company of infantry usually consisted of
men armed five different ways; in every hundred
men forty were "<em>men-at-arms</em>," and sixty "<em>shot</em>;"
the "men-at-arms" were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe
men, and thirty pikemen; and the "shot" were
twenty archers, twenty musketeers, and twenty
harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides his
principal weapon, a sword and dagger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>Companies of infantry varied at this period in
numbers from 150 to 300 men; each company had
a colour or ensign, and the mode of formation recommended
by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was:&mdash;the colour in the centre of
the company guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen
in equal proportions, on each flank of the
halberdiers: half the musketeers on each flank of
the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were
much lighter than the muskets then in use) in equal
proportions on each flank of the company for skirmishing.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was customary to unite a number of companies
into one body, called a <span class="smcap">Regiment</span>, which
frequently amounted to three thousand men: but
each company continued to carry a colour. Numerous
improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found
impossible to make armour proof against the muskets
then in use (which carried a very heavy ball) without
its being too weighty for the soldier, armour was
gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse,
and the infantry were reduced to two classes,
viz.: <em>musketeers</em>, armed with matchlock muskets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
swords, and daggers; and <em>pikemen</em>, armed with pikes
from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century
Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, reduced the
strength of regiments to 1000 men. He caused the
gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in
flasks, or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing
a charge, to be made up into cartridges, and
carried in pouches; and he formed each regiment
into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming
four regiments into a brigade; and the number
of colours was afterwards reduced to three in each
regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that
his infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated
Polish horsemen and Austrian cuirassiers; and his
armies became the admiration of other nations. His
mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great
was the prejudice in favour of ancient customs, that
all his improvements were not adopted until near a
century afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service,
styled the Admiral's regiment. In 1678
each company of 100 men usually consisted of 30
pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with
light firelocks. In this year the King added a company
of men armed with hand-grenades to each of
the old British regiments, which was designated the
"grenadier company." Daggers were so contrived
as to fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
similar to those at present in use were adopted about
twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p>An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by
order of King James II., to guard the artillery, and
was designated the Royal Fusiliers (now 7th Foot).
This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.</p>

<p>King William III. incorporated the Admiral's
regiment in the second Foot Guards, and raised
two Marine regiments for sea-service. During the
war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14
pikemen and 46 musketeers; the captains carried
pikes; lieutenants, partisans; ensigns, half-pikes;
and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in 1697 the
Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again
formed on the breaking out of the war in 1702.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were
laid aside, and every infantry soldier was armed
with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the grenadiers
ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside
their third colour: the corps of Royal Artillery was
first added to the Army in this reign.</p>

<p>About the year 1745, the men of the battalion
companies of infantry ceased to carry swords; during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
the reign of George II. light companies were added
to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers
should lay aside their swords, as that weapon had
never been used during the seven years' war. Since
that period the arms of the infantry soldier have been
limited to the musket and bayonet.</p>

<p>The arms and equipment of the British troops have
seldom differed materially, since the Conquest, from
those of other European states; and in some respects
the arming has, at certain periods, been allowed to
be inferior to that of the nations with whom they
have had to contend; yet, under this disadvantage,
the bravery and superiority of the British infantry
have been evinced on very many and most trying
occasions, and splendid victories have been gained
over very superior numbers.</p>

<p>Great Britain has produced a race of lion-like
champions who have dared to confront a host of
foes, and have proved themselves valiant with any
arms. At <em>Crecy</em> King Edward III., at the head of
about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August,
1346, Philip King of France, whose army is said to
have amounted to 100,000 men; here British valour
encountered veterans of renown:&mdash;the King of Bohemia,
the King of Majorca, and many princes and
nobles were slain, and the French army was routed
and cut to pieces. Ten years afterwards, Edward
Prince of Wales, who was designated the Black
Prince, defeated, at <em>Poictiers</em>, with 14,000 men,
a French army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry,
and took John I., King of France, and his son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October, 1415,
King Henry V., with an army of about 13,000
men, although greatly exhausted by marches, privations,
and sickness, defeated, at <em>Agincourt</em>, the
Constable of France, at the head of the flower of
the French nobility and an army said to amount to
60,000 men, and gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>During the seventy years' war between the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy,
which commenced in 1578 and terminated
in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States-General were celebrated for their unconquerable
spirit and firmness;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in the thirty
years' war between the Protestant Princes and the
Emperor of Germany, the British troops in the service
of Sweden and other states were celebrated for
deeds of heroism.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the wars of Queen Anne,
the fame of the British army under the great
<span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed
within the memory of persons now living, there is
abundant proof that the Britons of the present age
are not inferior to their ancestors in the qualities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds
of the brave men, of whom there are many now
surviving, who fought in Egypt in 1801, under the
brave Abercromby, and compelled the French army,
which had been vainly styled <em>Invincible</em>, to evacuate
that country; also the services of the gallant
Troops during the arduous campaigns in the Peninsula,
under the immortal <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and the
determined stand made by the British Army at
Waterloo, where Napoleon Bonaparte, who had
long been the inveterate enemy of Great Britain,
and had sought and planned her destruction by
every means he could devise, was compelled to
leave his vanquished legions to their fate, and to
place himself at the disposal of the British Government.
These achievements, with others of recent
dates in the distant climes of India, prove that the
same valour and constancy which glowed in the
breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers, Agincourt,
Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate the
Britons of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust
and muscular frame,&mdash;intrepidity which no danger
can appal,&mdash;unconquerable spirit and resolution,&mdash;patience
in fatigue and privation, and cheerful obedience
to his superiors. These qualities, united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate
and give a skilful direction to the energies and
adventurous spirit of the hero, and a wise selection
of officers of superior talent to command, whose
presence inspires confidence,&mdash;have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
arms.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fame of the deeds of the past and
present generations in the various battle-fields where
the robust sons of Albion have fought and conquered,
surrounds the British arms with a halo of glory;
these achievements will live in the page of history to
the end of time.</p>

<p>The records of the several regiments will be found
to contain a detail of facts of an interesting character,
connected with the hardships, sufferings, and gallant
exploits of British soldiers in the various parts of the
world, where the calls of their Country and the commands
of their Sovereign have required them to
proceed in the execution of their duty, whether in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
active continental operations, or in maintaining colonial
territories in distant and unfavourable climes.</p>

<p>The superiority of the British infantry has been
pre-eminently set forth in the wars of six centuries,
and admitted by the greatest commanders which
Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i>, as at present practised, while
they are adapted to every species of warfare, and to
all probable situations and circumstances of service,
are calculated to show forth the brilliancy of military
tactics calculated upon mathematical and scientific
principles. Although the movements and evolutions
have been copied from the continental armies, yet
various improvements have from time to time been
introduced, to insure that simplicity and celerity by
which the superiority of the national military character
is maintained. The rank and influence which
Great Britain has attained among the nations of the
world, have in a great measure been purchased by
the valour of the Army, and to persons who have the
welfare of their country at heart, the records of the
several regiments cannot fail to prove interesting.</p>

which had materially impaired the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages

<div class="sidenote">1688</div>

<p class="noindent">In the autumn of 1688, when the pernicious counsellors
of King James II. had induced His Majesty to adopt
measures which indicated a design to overthrow the
constitution and established religion of the country,
and many patriotic noblemen and gentlemen had
solicited the Prince of Orange to come to England
with an army, to preserve the liberties and religion
of the people, the King then became sensible of the
dangerous position into which he had been brought,
and resolved to augment his army: and among the
corps embodied on that occasion was a regiment of
pikemen and musketeers, which has been retained in
the service to the present time, and now bears the title
of "The <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span>, or the <span class="smcap">Bedfordshire</span> Regiment
of Foot."</p>

<p>This corps was raised in the southern counties of
England, and the colonelcy was conferred on Lieut.-Colonel
Archibald Douglas, from the royal regiment
of foot, by commission dated the 9th of October, 1688.
Captain Robert Hodges, from the grenadier company
of the royal regiment, was appointed Lieut.-Colonel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and Murdock M'Kenzie was nominated Major. The
establishment was fixed at nine hundred and twenty-seven
officers and soldiers, including a grenadier
company, which was afterwards ordered to be added
to the regiment. The uniform was round hats, ornamented
with <em>white</em> ribands; <em>red</em> coats, lined and faced
with <em>white</em>; white waistcoats and breeches.</p>

<p>Five days after the warrants for the formation of
the regiment were issued, a number of men had enrolled
themselves under the standards of this corps,&mdash;principally
from the county of Middlesex; and they were
ordered to march to Reading in Berkshire, where the
several enlisting parties were directed to assemble,
and the formation of the corps was completed.</p>

<p>Early in November, when the armament under the
Prince of Orange had passed Dover, the regiment was
ordered to march to London, and occupy quarters in
the borough of Southwark; it was afterwards directed
to join the army: but the pernicious advice of the
King's counsellors proved fatal to his interests; his
soldiers refused to fight against the Prince of Orange;
and some irregular orders were issued which appeared
to leave the officers and men at liberty to quit their
colours, when a number of corps were disbanded. The
Prince of Orange issued orders for the several corps
to be re-organised, and appointed quarters for every
regiment;&mdash;the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> were directed to occupy
quarters at Stony Stratford, in Buckinghamshire.
King James afterwards fled to France.</p>

<p>Colonel Douglas adhered to the interest of King
James, and the Prince of Orange promoted Lieut.-Colonel
Hodges to the colonelcy of the regiment, by
commission dated the 31st of December, 1688.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1689</div>

<p>In the early part of 1689 the Prince and Princess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Orange were elevated to the throne by the titles of
King William the Third and Queen Mary; and soon
afterwards the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> regiment received orders to
proceed to Holland, to aid the Dutch in their war
with France. It embarked for the United Provinces
in April, and served the campaign of that year under
Prince Waldeck; in August it was in position in the
province of Namur.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 25th of August, the
musketeers of the regiment, with the piquets of several
other corps, commanded by Colonel Hodges of the
<span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span>, advanced to cover the numerous foraging
parties sent to the villages and fields in front of the
army, and Colonel Hodges posted his men at, and in
front of, the village of Forgé. About nine o'clock the
French army under Marshal d'Humières was seen
advancing to attack the confederate forces, when three
guns were fired to call in the foragers, and Colonel
Hodges prepared to resist the leading corps of the
enemy to give time for the several parties to withdraw.
The Dutch and Danish horse in front were speedily
driven in; but the musketeers of the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> and
other corps under Colonel Hodges lined the hedges,
and held a force of very superior numbers in check
nearly two hours, when, the foraging parties having
all returned to camp, Colonel Hodges withdrew to a
mill, and, posting his men behind walls and out-buildings,
he held the French army in check nearly an hour,
the shots of his marksmen smiting the leading companies
of the enemy with sure aim. At length he received
orders to retire, and withdrew fighting, until he came
to the village of <em>Walcourt</em>, where a regiment of Lunenburgers
was posted. The French attempted to carry
the village by storm; but were repulsed, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
eventually forced to retreat, with severe loss. Colonel
Hodges' party had Lieut.-Colonel Graham, Captain
Davison, and thirty men, killed.</p>

<p>In October the regiment marched to Bruges, where
it was stationed during the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1690</div>

<p>The regiment marched for Brussels in June, 1690,
in order to join the Dutch forces; but Prince Waldeck
engaged the French at Fleurus, without waiting for
the arrival of the British troops, and his army was
nearly annihilated; which reduced the confederate
forces to the necessity of limiting their services to
defensive operations during the remainder of the
campaign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1691</div>

<p>Leaving its winter quarters in March, 1691, the
regiment joined the army in South Brabant, and was
formed in brigade with the Scots foot guards, a battalion
of the royals, and the Scots regiments of Ramsay,
Angus, and Mackay; but the confederate army was not
sufficiently numerous to prevent the French capturing
Mons. During the summer the regiment took part
in various manœuvres; but no general engagement
occurred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1692</div>

<p>In the spring of 1692, when the French besieged
Namur, the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> were called from their winter
quarters, and joined the army under the command of
King William III., who advanced to relieve the besieged
fortress, but was delayed by heavy rains, and the
garrison surrendered before the end of June.</p>

<p>After several movements King William resolved to
attack the French army, under Marshal Luxemburg,
at its camp at <em>Steenkirk</em>, on the 3rd of August. The
leading corps penetrated along difficult roads, and
attacked the French army with great gallantry; but
the main body of the confederate troops was too far in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the rear to afford timely support, and the King ordered
a retreat. The <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> were brought into action
on this occasion, and exposed to the enemy's fire, when
Colonel Hodges was killed at the head of the regiment
by a cannon-ball: his death was much regretted, he
being a gallant and intelligent officer, much esteemed
and beloved by the soldiers.</p>

<p>King William conferred the colonelcy of the regiment
on the Honorable James Stanley, afterwards Earl of
Derby, from Captain and Lieut.-Colonel in the first
foot guards.</p>

<p>Towards the end of August the regiment was
detached, with other troops, under Lieut.-General
Talmash, who moved towards Bruges: at the same
time Furnes and Dixmude were taken possession of
and fortified.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1693</div>

<p>The regiment served the campaign of 1693 in the
brigade commanded by Brigadier-General Erle. It
took part in several movements, and was in position
when the confederate army was attacked at <em>Landen</em>,
on the 29th of July, by the French, under Marshal
Luxemburg. The enemy had a great superiority of
numbers on this occasion, and the confederate army
was forced to retreat. It was stated in the London
Gazette, "the enemy had above eighty thousand
effective men; we were not more than forty-five
thousand. * * * Our troops in general behaved
themselves extremely well, but the English did particularly
distinguish themselves." The regiment had
Captain Cole and Ensign Johnston killed, and Ensign
Campion taken prisoner; it also lost upwards of fifty
men, killed, wounded, and taken prisoners.</p>

<p>At the end of the campaign the regiment was placed
in garrison at Dendermond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1694</div>

<p>Quitting its winter quarters in May, 1694, the regiment
joined the army, and served the campaign of this
year in the brigade commanded by Brigadier-General
Collier: it afterwards returned to Dendermond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1695</div>

<p>In 1695 King William undertook the siege of <em>Namur</em>,
and the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> had the honor to take part in
the capture of this important fortress. They joined the
besieging army, and were on duty in the trenches on
the 7th of July; and they were repeatedly engaged
in storming the outworks and exterior defences. On
the 17th of July Ensign Gardiner of the regiment was
killed, and Ensign Devreux wounded, at the attack on
the counterscarp; and on the 2nd of August, Captain
Holiday of the grenadier company was wounded at
the extending of the lodgment on the covered way.
On the following day, when preparations were making
for another assault, the garrison hoisted a white flag
and agreed to surrender the town.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> were selected to take part in the
siege of the castle of Namur, and were encamped at
Maison Blanche; but, having lost many men, they were
relieved on the 11th of August, and joined the covering
army under the Prince of Vaudemont. They were
encamped a short time between Genappe and Waterloo;
afterwards near Namur; and the grenadier company
took part in the attack on the castle, which capitulated
on the 2nd of September. The regiment afterwards
returned to Dendermond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1696<br />1697</div>

<p>Leaving its winter quarters in the spring of 1696,
the regiment joined the army of Brabant under King
William, and served the campaign of that year in
Brigadier-General Fitzpatrick's brigade. It served the
campaign of 1697 in the brigade under Brigadier-General
Ingoldsby; and in the autumn the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
monarch witnessed his efforts to preserve the reformed
religion, and the balance of power in Europe, attended
with success. The treaty of Ryswick gave peace to the
nations of Europe; and the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> regiment embarked
for Ireland, where it was stationed until the
summer of 1701, reposing on the reputation which it
had acquired on the continent, where it had served
seven campaigns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1701</div>

<p>In the meantime the French monarch had violated
the liberties of Europe, by procuring the accession of
his grandson, the Duke of Anjou, to the throne of
Spain,&mdash;by seizing on the Spanish Netherlands and
detaining the Dutch garrisons in the barrier towns:
and the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> were called from their quarters in
Ireland to reinforce the Dutch army. The regiment
embarked from Carrickfergus on the 7th of June, and
sailed to the island of Voorn, where it was removed on
board of Dutch vessels, and proceeded up the Maese
to the fortress of Huesden, where it remained two
months, then proceeded to Breda, and was reviewed on
Breda heath by King William on the 21st of September,
afterwards returning to Huesden.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1702</div>

<p>In March, 1702, the regiment traversed the country
to Rosendael, where the British corps were assembled
under Brigadier-General Ingoldsby, and received
information of the death of King William, and the
accession of Queen Anne, on the 8th of March. The
regiment afterwards marched across the country to the
duchy of Cleves, and encamped at Cranenburg,
forming part of the covering army during the siege of
<em>Kayserswerth</em> by the Germans. On the night of the
10th of June the covering army made a forced march
to <em>Nimeguen</em> to avoid the loss of communication
with that fortress, in consequence of the movements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the enemy. On the following morning the British corps
in the rear-guard distinguished themselves in a sharp
skirmish with the leading columns of the French army.</p>

<p>Queen Anne declared war against France; additional
troops were sent to Holland, and the Earl of Marlborough
assumed the command of the allied army.
The <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> shared in the operations by which the
French army was forced to retire from the frontiers of
Holland; and they formed part of the covering army
during the sieges of <em>Venloo</em>, <em>Ruremonde</em>, and <em>Stevenswaert</em>;
took part in delivering the city of <em>Liege</em> from the power
of the enemy; and their grenadier company distinguished
itself in the capture of the citadel by storm
on the 23rd of October. The regiment afterwards
marched back to Holland for winter quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1703</div>

<p>Towards the end of April, 1703, the regiment commenced
its march towards Maestricht, and was in position
near that city when the French army approached
in order of battle, but did not venture to hazard a
general engagement. The regiment shared in the
operations by which the French were afterwards
forced to make a precipitate retreat and take post
behind their fortified lines. The services of the
regiment were also connected with the siege and
capture of the fortress of <em>Huy</em>, on the Maese river,
above the city of Liege; and with the siege of the
city of <em>Limburg</em>, situate on a pleasant eminence among
woods near the banks of the Wesdet, which place surrendered
on the 28th of September. After these conquests
the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> returned to Holland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1704</div>

<p>During the winter six hundred men of the regiment
joined the garrison of Maestricht, while the Dutch soldiers
were working at the entrenchments on the heights of
Petersberg: in May, 1704, the remainder of the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
marched towards the Rhine, and was joined at
Bedburg by the detachment from Maestricht.</p>

<p>The Duke of Marlborough led his army from
Holland to the heart of Germany, and, there encountering
the legions of France and Bavaria, he gained two
important victories on the banks of the Danube, and
exalted the reputation of the British arms. The
<span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> had the honor to share in this splendid
enterprise, and to take a distinguished part in gaining
the victory at <em>Schellenberg</em> on the 2nd of July, when
the regiment had Major Mordaunt, Ensign Charleston,
one serjeant, and nineteen soldiers killed; Lieut.-Colonel
Hamilton, Captain Coghlan, Ensign Key, one
serjeant, and thirty-four rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>After this victory the regiment crossed the Danube
and marched to the vicinity of the enemy's fortified
camp at Augsburg, which was found too strong to be
attacked, and the army retired a few stages, the
Germans commencing the siege of Ingoldstadt. The
enemy, being reinforced from France, took up a position
in the valley of the Danube, near the village of
<em>Blenheim</em>, which was occupied by a considerable body
of troops; and on the memorable 13th of August a
general engagement took place, in which the English
general was once more victorious; the French and
Bavarian army sustaining a decisive overthrow, with
the loss of its artillery and baggage, and many entire
regiments being made prisoners; the French commander,
Marshal Tallard, being among the captives.
The <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> regiment was one of the corps which
sustained the brunt of the battle on this occasion, and
acquired great honor. The loss of the regiment was
very great: Captain Coghlan, Lieutenant Brown,
Ensigns Sabine and Hesketh, were among the killed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and Lieut.-Colonel Hamilton, Captains Hesketh,
Fleming, Lee, and Horne, Lieutenants Vicariage,
Jackson, Ayloffe, and Reddish, Ensigns Mackrich,
Hook, and Gordon, wounded.</p>

<p>From the banks of the Danube the regiment traversed
the country to Philipsburg, where it crossed the
Rhine, and formed part of the covering army encamped
at Croon-Weissemberg, during the siege of <em>Landau</em>
by the Germans. In the autumn the regiment embarked
in boats on the Rhine, and sailed to Holland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1705</div>

<p>The losses of the preceding campaigns were replaced
in the spring of 1705 by recruits from England, and,
when the regiment took the field to serve the campaign
of 1705, its appearance and efficiency were admired.
It was employed in the expedition up the Moselle, and,
passing the Moselle and the Saar rivers on the 3rd of
June, advanced towards Syrk; but the designs of
the British commander were frustrated by the tardy
movements of the Germans, and he marched back to
the Netherlands.</p>

<p>In May of this year the Earl of Derby retired from
the service, and was succeeded in the colonelcy by
Lieut.-Colonel Francis Godfrey, from the foot-guards.</p>

<p>A stupendous barrier of fortified lines, forts, and
batteries opposed the progress of the British commander;
but by skilful movements these works were
passed at the slenderly-guarded posts of <em>Helixem</em> and
<em>Neer-Hespen</em> on the 18th of July. On this occasion
the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> formed part of Brigadier-General
Fergusson's brigade in the main body of the army,
and did not sustain any loss. It shared in the subsequent
operations of the campaign, and passed the
winter in garrison in Holland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1706</div>

<p>The <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> had the honor to take part in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
battle of <em>Ramilies</em>, on the 23rd of May, 1706, when the
French, Spanish, and Bavarian forces, commanded by
Marshal Villeroy and the Elector of Bavaria, were
forced from their formidable position with severe loss,
and pursued many miles.</p>

<p>Important results followed this triumph over the
forces of Louis XIV.; the states of Brabant and magistrates
of Brussels renounced their allegiance to the
Duke of Anjou; the principal towns of Brabant and
several fortified places in Flanders were immediately
delivered up, and others surrendered after short sieges.
Thus provinces disputed for ages, and towns which
had resisted powerful armies for months and years,
were conquered in one campaign. After taking part
in these splendid achievements, the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> marched
into quarters at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1707</div>

<p>The regiment was in the field during the campaign
of 1707; but the French avoided an engagement, and
nothing of importance occurred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1708</div>

<p>In the spring of 1708 the King of France fitted out a
fleet, and prepared a land force for the invasion of Great
Britain in favour of the Pretender, and the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span>
were ordered to return to England to repel the invaders:
they arrived at Tynemouth on the 21st of March; but the
French fleet having been chased from the British coast by
the English navy, the regiment returned to Flanders.</p>

<p>After remaining a few weeks at Ghent, the regiment
joined the army in the field, and took part in achieving
another victory over the armies of Louis XIV., in the
fields near <em>Oudenarde</em>, on the 11th of July. The
<span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> formed part of a division of twenty battalions
commanded by the Duke of Argyle, which
traversed the Scheldt by the pontoon bridge between
Oudenarde and the abbey of Eename, ascended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
heights of Bevere, and, inclining to the right, engaged
the enemy in the open grounds beyond the rivulet;
when a fierce conflict of musketry ensued, and the
French were driven from field to field, with great
slaughter, until the darkness of the night rendered it
impossible to distinguish friends from foes, when the
troops were directed to cease firing. The wreck of the
French army made a precipitate retreat.</p>

<p>The siege of the important fortress of <em>Lisle</em> was afterwards
undertaken, and the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> were selected
to take part in this gigantic enterprise, which excited
universal attention throughout Europe; the strength
of the place,&mdash;the garrison consisting of fifteen thousand
men under the celebrated Marshal Boufflers, and being
provided with everything necessary for a protracted
defence,&mdash;gave an interesting character to this undertaking.</p>

<p>When the besieging army appeared before Lisle, the
French out-guards retired, and <em>Serjeant Littler</em> of the
<span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> regiment swam across the river with a
hatchet, and cut the fastenings which held up a drawbridge
to enable a party to pass the stream, for which
act of gallantry he was rewarded with a commission in
the third foot, or the Buffs.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> regiment took its turn of duty in the
trenches and shared in the attacks during the siege of
Lisle, evincing, on all occasions, the same heroic gallantry
for which it had previously been distinguished.
It had one serjeant and eleven rank and file killed,
and four serjeants and fifty rank and file wounded, at
the storming of the counterscarp; and sustained severe
loss on several other occasions. Numerous difficulties
had to be overcome in carrying on this siege; but the
skill, valour, and perseverance of the officers and soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of the allied army, overcame every obstacle, and on the
9th of December the citadel surrendered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1709</div>

<p>After reposing a few weeks in quarters, and receiving
a draft of recruits from England, the regiment advanced
up the country, and was encamped with the army on
the Upper Dyle; it was subsequently employed in
covering the siege of <em>Tournay</em>, and after the surrender
of the town, on the 29th of July, 1708, the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span>
were selected to take part in the siege of the citadel.
This proved a difficult service, in consequence of the
extensive subterraneous works by which the fortress
was surrounded. The approaches were carried on
underground, and the working parties frequently penetrated
the subterraneous labyrinths of the castle, and,
encountering detachments of the enemy, fought underground
with sword, pistol, and bayonet. Several
parties were destroyed by the mines; but the works
were persevered in, and the garrison surrendered in
the beginning of September.</p>

<p>After the capture of Tournay the army marched
towards Mons; but finding a numerous French force,
under Marshals Villars and Boufflers, in position at
<em>Malplaquet</em>, the enemy was attacked in his fortified
post on the morning of the 11th of September, and the
<span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> had the honor to contribute to the gaining
of another victory over the armies of France. On this
occasion, the regiment was formed in brigade with the
Buffs and the regiments of Temple and Evans (afterwards
disbanded), and was engaged in the attack of the
woods in which the enemy's left wing was posted, and
in its advance it encountered entrenchments and
breastworks bristling with bayonets, and emitting a
storm of musket-shot and cannon-balls, which thinned
the British ranks. The leading corps were repulsed;
but, fresh troops arriving, a general attack was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
with so much resolution that the French were driven
from their entrenchments into the wood, where a sharp
fire of musketry was kept up, and the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> were
engaged among the trees. Finally the French were
overpowered at every part of the field, and forced to
retreat.</p>

<p>The regiment had about fifty men killed and
wounded; and Captain Ayloffe, Lieutenants Macrath,
Whiting, and Lawder wounded. It was afterwards
employed in covering the siege of <em>Mons</em>, and passed the
winter in quarters at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1710</div>

<p>Having received another draft of recruits, the regiment
marched in April, 1710, to the vicinity of Tournay,
where the army was directed to assemble; its
services were connected with the forcing of the enemy's
fortified lines at <em>Pont-à-Vendin</em>; it also formed part of
the covering army during the siege of <em>Douay</em>, which
fortress surrendered on the 27th of June. The regiment
was afterwards employed in covering the siege of
<em>Bethune</em>, and this fortress was captured before the end
of August. The French army avoiding a general
engagement, the fortresses of <em>Aire</em> and <em>St. Venant</em> were
besieged at the same time, and after the capture of
these towns, the regiment returned to Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1711</div>

<p>Brigadier-General Godfrey withdrew from the service,
and was succeeded in the colonelcy of the regiment
by Brigadier-General Henry Durell, from the foot
guards, by commission dated the 17th of February,
1711.</p>

<p>In the campaign of this year the regiment shared in
the operations by which the boasted impregnable lines,
prepared by the French to arrest the progress of the
allied armies, were passed at <em>Arleux</em>, on the 5th of
August, and it was subsequently engaged in the siege
of the strong fortress of <em>Bouchain</em>,&mdash;services which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
called forth all the powers of the active mind of the
Duke of Marlborough, who proved himself superior to
the French generals in all the qualities which constitute
a great commander. Bouchain having been
captured, the regiment was placed in garrison for the
winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1712</div>

<p>Once more taking the field in April, 1712, the regiment
joined the army near Tournay, from whence it
marched to the vicinity of Bouchain, and was
encamped at Cateau-Cambresis during the siege of
<em>Quesnoy</em> by the Germans; it brought six hundred and
eighty-one rank and file into the field. The garrison
of <em>Quesnoy</em> surrendered on the 4th of July; and soon
afterwards a suspension of arms was proclaimed preparatory
to a treaty of peace, and the British troops
withdrew to the vicinity of Ghent, from whence the
<span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> were detached to Dunkirk, which city the
French monarch delivered into the hands of the British,
as a pledge of his sincerity in the negotiations for
peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1713</div>

<p>On the 1st of December, 1712, Brigadier-General
Durell died, and Queen Anne conferred the colonelcy
of the regiment on Brigadier-General Hans Hamilton,
from the thirty-fourth regiment, by commission dated
the 23rd of June, 1713.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1714</div>

<p>The regiment was stationed at Dunkirk until April,
1714, when it embarked for Scotland, and, landing at
Leith, relieved the twenty-fifth regiment, which was
ordered to embark for Ireland. The <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> were
stationed at Stirling in September, 1714, with the
Inniskilling dragoons, when the arrival in London of
King George I. from Hanover, was celebrated with
public rejoicings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1715</div>

<p>In the summer of 1715 the colonelcy of the regiment
was conferred on the Lieut.-Colonel, Richard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Viscount Irving, in succession to Brigadier-General
Hamilton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1716</div>

<p>A rebellion in favour of the Pretender broke out in
Scotland in the autumn of this year, and the Earl of
Mar headed the insurgent clans; but the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span>
did not take the field: the protection of Fort William
was entrusted to their charge; and they were in garrison
at this place in the early part of 1716, when the
rebellion was suppressed by the troops under the Duke
of Argyle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1717<br />1724</div>

<p>In December, 1717, Viscount Irving was removed to
the second horse, now first dragoon guards, and was
succeeded by Lieut.-Colonel John Cholmeley; and this
officer dying in April, 1724, King George I. conferred
the colonelcy on Henry Earl of Deloraine (son of James
Duke of Monmouth), from the Scots troop of horse-grenadier-guards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1725<br />1727</div>

<p>The regiment was employed on home service in Great
Britain during the whole of the reign of King George
I.; it was one of the corps selected to proceed to
Holland in 1727, to assist the Dutch in their war with
the Imperialists; but no embarkation took place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1730</div>

<p>On the 9th of July, 1730, the Earl of Deloraine was
removed to the seventh horse, now sixth dragoon-guards,
and the colonelcy of the regiment was conferred
by King George II. on Colonel Roger Handasyd, from
the twenty-second regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1737</div>

<p>In 1737 the British merchants complained of the
depredations committed on their vessels by the
Spaniards in South America. A Convention was entered
into between the two Crowns, which was, however,
violated by the Spaniards in many instances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1739</div>

<p>On the 23rd of October, 1739, a declaration of war
against Spain was proclaimed, when the establishment
of the regiment was augmented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1740</div>

<p>In the summer of 1740 the regiment pitched its
tents near Newbury, where an encampment was formed
of two regiments of horse, three of dragoons, and four
of infantry, under Lieut.-General Wade. The <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span>
left the camp and embarked on board the fleet,
where they served as Marines a short time, and afterwards
landed at Portsmouth. In the autumn they
furnished a detachment to accompany the expedition to
the West Indies, under General Lord Cathcart, who
died on the passage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1741</div>

<p>The expedition arrived at Jamaica in January, 1741,
and the detachment of the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> was employed
in the attempt on <em>Carthagena</em>, the capital of an extensive
and wealthy province in the country of Terra Firma,
in South America. The violent periodical rains
occurred before the conquest was achieved, and the
armament proved of insufficient strength to capture the
place; the country became deluged with water, the
health of the soldiers was seriously impaired, and the
enterprise was abandoned. The detachment of the
<span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> was nearly annihilated by disease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1742</div>

<p>In this year the war of the Austrian succession
commenced; and in 1742 a British army proceeded to
Flanders to support the interests of the Archduchess,
Maria Theresa; but the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> were employed on
home service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1745</div>

<p>Charles Edward, eldest son of the Pretender, arrived
in Scotland in the summer of 1745, and being joined
by a number of the Highland clans, he made a desperate
effort to overthrow the existing government, and to
procure the accession of his father to the throne. At
first some partial successes were gained by the insurgents;
but the British nation evinced firmness and
decision in supporting the rights of their sovereign, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
in preserving the constitutional privileges of the people.
The services of the regiment were, at this period,
limited to the south of England, where a body of
troops was held in readiness to repel a menaced
invasion by the French.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746</div>

<p>In January, 1746, the royal troops, under Lieut.-General
Hawley, were defeated by the Clans, on Falkirk
moor, and additional forces were ordered to proceed to
Scotland. In March the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> regiment embarked
from Gravesend, with several other corps, for
Edinburgh, and arrived at Leith as the guns of Edinburgh
castle were firing for the decisive victory gained
over the clans at Culloden. The regiment waited a
few days on board the transports, until the return of
an express from the army, when it received orders to
sail northwards, and landed at the royal burgh of
Nairn on the 1st of May. It was subsequently stationed
at Elgin, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747</div>

<p>The regiment remained in Scotland, and in the
summer of 1747 it was encamped in a valley environed
by lofty mountains, near Fort Augustus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1748<br />1749</div>

<p>The war on the Continent terminated in 1748; and
in the following year the regiment was reduced in
numbers to the peace establishment, and sent to Ireland,
where it was stationed nearly twenty years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1751</div>

<p>On the 1st of July, 1751, King George II. issued a
warrant for establishing uniformity in the clothing,
standards, and colours of the several regiments of the
regular army; and in this warrant the uniform of the
<span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span>, or Lieut.-General Roger Handasyd's regiment,
was directed to be red, faced with <em>yellow</em>.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
first, or the King's colour, to be the great Union: the
second, or regimental colour, to be of yellow silk, with
the Union in the upper canton; in the centre of the
colours, the rank of the regiment, in gold Roman characters,
within a wreath of roses and thistles on the
same stalk.</p>

<p>At this period the soldiers of the regiment wore
three-cornered cocked hats, bound with white lace, and
ornamented with a white loop and a black cockade;
red waistcoats; red breeches; white gaiters reaching
above the knee, and fastened below the knee with a
black garter; and white cravats; they also wore buff
cross-belts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1755<br />1756<br />1757<br />1758<br />1760</div>

<p>The undetermined extent of the British territory in
North America gave rise to hostilities with France in
1755, and the establishment of the army was considerably
augmented in that and the two following
years. Several expeditions were also fitted out; but
the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> regiment was detained on home service
in Ireland. In 1760 a plan was formed for attacking
the French island of Belleisle, and the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span>,
mustering seven hundred men, under Lieut.-Colonel
Gabbet, embarked on board of the fleet; but the enterprise
was laid aside in consequence of the death of
King George II., and the regiment returned to Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1762</div>

<p>On the termination of the war in 1762, the regiment
was again reduced to the peace establishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1763</div>

<p>General Roger Handasyd died in January, 1763, and
in June King George III. conferred the colonelcy of the
regiment on the Honorable Robert Brudenell, third
son of George Earl of Cardigan, from captain and
lieut.-colonel in the third foot guards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1765</div>

<p>In 1765 Colonel Brudenell was removed to the
Fourth regiment of foot, and was succeeded in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
colonelcy of the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span>, by Colonel William Draper,
who had commanded one of the regiments raised
in 1757, and numbered the Seventy-ninth regiment,
which was disbanded in 1763.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1766</div>

<p>Colonel Draper was honoured with the dignity of a
Knight of the Bath, and in 1766 he exchanged to the
colonelcy of one of the corps disbanded in 1763 (the
121st regiment) with Colonel James Gisborne, who
was performing the duty of Quartermaster-General
in Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1767</div>

<p>The regiment embarked from Ireland in 1767, for
North America, and was stationed in the pleasant and
fertile territory of Florida, which had been ceded to
Great Britain, by the Spaniards, in 1763, in exchange
for the Havannah.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1768</div>

<p>The head-quarters were established at Pensacola,&mdash;a
town of West Florida, situate at the head of a
delightful bay, or basin, in the Gulf of Mexico; and
the regiment furnished various detachments to occupy
military stations in East and West Florida.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1775<br />1776<br />1777</div>

<p>In these pleasant and healthy quarters the regiment
was stationed when a number of the British colonies
in North America revolted, and declared themselves a
free and independent people, under the title of the
United States. This occurred in 1775, and in the following
year the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> were withdrawn from Florida,
to join the army at New York, under Lieut.-General
Sir William Howe; but the necessity of having a small
force in the ceded Spanish province was evident, and
the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> having, during their residence of eight
years in East and West Florida, acquired the confidence
of the inhabitants and a knowledge of the country,
and of the habits and language of the people, the
regiment received orders to return to Pensacola, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
other stations in East and West Florida, and on the
confines of Georgia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Gisborne died on the 20th of February,
1778, and King George III. conferred the colonelcy on
Major-General James Robertson, from Colonel Commandant
of the second battalion of the Sixtieth, who
had previously performed the duties of Lieut.-Colonel
of the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> regiment, many years, with reputation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778<br />1779</div>

<p>Had the British revolted provinces been left unaided
by European states, they would, doubtless, have been
reduced to submission; but in 1778 the French monarch
sent a numerous fleet and an army to their assistance;
and in 1779 the court of Spain commenced
hostilities against Great Britain, and this example was
followed by the Dutch.</p>

<p>Don Bernard de Galvez, governor of the Spanish
province of Louisiana, assembled a numerous force, and
suddenly invaded the British territories on the banks
of the Mississippi; and Lieut.-Colonel Dickson, of the
<span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span>, who commanded the troops in that district,
being unable to oppose the invading army, withdrew
to <em>Baton Rouge</em>, where he caused a redoubt to be constructed,
which was scarcely completed when the
Spanish army advanced in force against this post,
which was invested on the 12th of September. On
the 21st the enemy opened a battery of heavy cannon
against the works, which were so much damaged in
a few hours, that Colonel Dickson was obliged to surrender.
The garrison, consisting of a detachment of
the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span>, Sixtieth, and of the Waldeck regiments,
was sent prisoners of war to New Orleans, and afterwards
exchanged.</p>

<p>The French armament, under the Comte d'Estaing,

county, in the state of Georgia, early in September,
and a detachment of the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> regiment, commanded
by Major Graham, formed part of the force
under Major-General Prevost, which defended that
place. The French troops landed, and were joined by
an American force under General Lincoln; but they
encountered a resistance which proved the determined
valour of the garrison. A detachment from the
<span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> was engaged in a sally on the 24th of
September, under Major Graham of the regiment, and
this service was performed with judgment and bravery.
"Major Graham artfully drew the enemy into a snare,
by which the French and Americans fired on each
other, and had fifty men killed before the mistake
was discovered."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Before daylight on the 9th of
October, the French and Americans made a desperate
effort to capture the place by storm; but were repulsed
at every point with severe loss. They afterwards
raised the siege and retired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1781</div>

<p>In 1781 the Spaniards sent a numerous sea and land
force against Florida, under Don Bernard de Galvez, and
the invading army commenced operations by an attack
upon the works defending <em>Pensacola</em>, where a detachment
of the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> regiment was stationed. From
the strength of the Spanish force, mustering nine
thousand men, and a numerous fleet, at the same time
the British garrison only amounted to twelve hundred
men, the reduction of the place appeared inevitable; yet
a gallant defence was made, and the soldiers displayed
that innate bravery and resolution for which British
troops have always been distinguished. On the morning
of the 8th of May a shell burst near the door of the
magazine of the advanced redoubt, set fire to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
powder, and the redoubt and its garrison were destroyed
by the explosion, excepting a few men, who were forced
to retire, after spiking the guns. The Spaniards
carried the redoubt, and threatened to storm the
remaining works; but were intimidated by the determined
bearing of the garrison. The British commander,
Major-General John Campbell, afterwards
agreed to surrender, on condition that the garrison
should march out with the honours of war, and be sent
to a part belonging to Great Britain, but not serve
against the Spaniards, or their allies, until exchanged.
The <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> had Lieutenant Edward Carroll and
seven soldiers killed; Captain Anthony Foster and
five soldiers wounded. Pensacola was a flourishing
place while under the British; but it declined after it
was taken by the Spaniards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782</div>

<p>The regiment having sustained severe loss from
various services in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina,
where detachments had been employed, it was
ordered to return to Europe, and arrived in England in
March, 1782.</p>

<p>In August the regiment received directions to assume
the title of the <span class="smcap">sixteenth, or the Buckingham</span> Regiment,
and to cultivate a connection with the respectable
inhabitants of that county, which might be useful
towards recruiting the regiment.</p>

<p>The American War terminated in 1782; and the regiment
was placed upon a peace establishment in 1783.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1784</div>

<p>In 1784 it embarked for Ireland, where it was stationed
several years under the orders of Lieut.-Colonel

100th regiment, which was reduced after the termination
of the American War.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1790<br />1791</div>

<p>On the 18th of August, 1790, the regiment embarked
from Ireland for Nova Scotia, and in 1791 it was
removed to the island of Jamaica, where it remained
five years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793<br />1794</div>

<p>A revolution broke out in France, and the republican
principles which filled that kingdom with anarchy,
confusion, and bloodshed, soon extended to the French
West India Settlements, where the blacks and mulattoes
rose in arms against the European planters, and filled
the islands with rapine and devastation. Many of the
respectable inhabitants of the French island of <em>St.
Domingo</em> solicited the protection of the British government
against the fury of the blacks, and a detachment
of British troops proceeded to their aid, from Jamaica,
in 1793. The <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> regiment furnished a portion
of this detachment, but the climate of St. Domingo
proved injurious to the health of the British troops,
and the whole of the party of the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> died of a
pestilential fever, excepting Lieutenant Vernon and
one serjeant, who rejoined the regiment at Jamaica.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<p>The island of Jamaica was taken from the Spaniards,
by an English armament in 1655 (during the commonwealth
under Cromwell), when the slaves belonging
to the Spanish planters fled to the mountains, where
they lived in savage independence, and were called
"Maroons." They procured arms, became expert
marksmen, and frequently committed outrages against
the British inhabitants. In 1738 a treaty was concluded
with them, and they received a grant of land;
but the pernicious doctrines of the French republicans
were circulated among the Maroons, who were joined
by a number of runaway slaves, and commenced hostilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
against the English in 1795. The <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span>
served in the <em>Maroon war</em>, when the soldiers encountered
many difficulties, and at first sustained some reverses,
from the difficult nature of the mountainous districts
into which they had to penetrate, and from the expert
character of the Maroon warriors in bush-fighting
among rocks and dells covered with trees and underwood.
A detachment of the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> was first called
into action; and in October the regiment, commanded
by Major John Skinner, who held the local rank of
Colonel, was called into the field. This officer had
served many years in the regiment; he had distinguished
himself in the American war, while serving
with Tarleton's Legion, with which corps he was
present at numerous engagements, and on joining the
field force in the Maroon war, his presence inspired the
troops with confidence. Offensive operations were
conducted with prudence and skill, and by a strict
combination in the movements of the troops employed,
united with valour and discipline, the Maroons were
driven from their mountain-fastnesses, and chased from
post to post, until they were forced to submit. In performing
this service, the soldiers underwent great
fatigue and privation, and they conquered the Maroons
in a part of the island where no European had ever
before thought of penetrating. Captain Drummond, of
the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span>, distinguished himself in this war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796</div>

<p>The Maroons tendered their submission in March,
1796, and they were afterwards removed from the island.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797</div>

<p>Having become considerably reduced in numbers, the
regiment returned to England, towards the close of
this year, and was stationed a short time at Greenwich,
from whence it embarked for Scotland, early in 1797;
at the same time it was ordered to recruit with boys.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General the Honorable Thomas Bruce having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
died, he was succeeded in the colonelcy by Major-General
Henry Bowyer, from the Eighty-ninth regiment,
by commission dated the 15th of December, 1797.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1798</div>

<p>The regiment was quartered in Fifeshire, under the
orders of Major John Skinner, and afterwards proceeded
to Fort George; Lieut.-Colonel Hugh Wallace assuming
the command. The boys were transferred to the
Thirty-fourth and Sixty-fifth regiments, under orders
for India, and the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> were completed by
volunteers from the English militia, principally limited
service men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1799</div>

<p>In 1799 the regiment embarked from Scotland for
London, from whence it proceeded to Margate, to join
the expedition to Holland, under His Royal Highness
the Duke of York; but the order to proceed on this
service was countermanded, and the regiment was
stationed a few months at Horsham in Sussex.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1800<br />1801</div>

<p>Embarking from Portsmouth in 1800, the regiment
sailed to Cork, and was stationed in the south of
Ireland; where Lieut.-Colonel St. John Fancourt
joined <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'and assume the'">and assumed the</ins> command in 1801.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<p>At the conclusion of the peace of Amiens in 1802,
the limited service men were discharged; and the
regiment was completed from disbanded fencible and
militia corps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>War was resumed in 1803; and Lieut.-Colonel
Fancourt having been removed to the Thirty-fourth
regiment, the command of the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> devolved on
Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Skinner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>On the 7th of January, 1804, the regiment embarked
from Monkstown, for the West Indies, and arrived at
Barbadoes on the 26th of March. It was immediately
ordered to hold itself in readiness to proceed with the
expedition under Major-General Sir Charles Green and
Commodore Samuel Hood, against the Dutch colony of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
<em>Surinam</em>, in Guiana, in South America. This colony was
ceded to the Dutch, by King Charles II., in exchange for
New York, in North America; it was captured by the
British in 1799, and restored at the peace of Amiens
in 1802.</p>

<p>On the 7th of April, 1804, the expedition sailed from
Barbadoes, and a landing was effected on the 26th of
that month; the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> were actively employed in
operations, until the surrender of the colony on the
4th of May.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>While the regiment was at Surinam, the post occupied
by a detachment of the light company and a few
men of the fourth West India regiment, commanded by
Lieutenant Richard Greene, of the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span>, at
<em>Armena</em>, was attacked by a large force of predatory
negroes and banditti, and defended with great gallantry,
the greater part of the garrison being killed in the
successful resistance made to the assailants. The inhabitants
of the colony afterwards presented Lieutenant
Greene with a valuable sword, in token of their sense
of his conduct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<p>In 1807 Lieut.-Colonel Skinner was succeeded in
the duties of commanding officer by Major Brabazon
Dean Vernon.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1808</div>

<p>On the decease of General Bowyer, in 1808, King
George III. conferred the colonelcy on Major-General
Sir Charles Green, Bart., from the York light infantry
volunteers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>In May, 1809, His Majesty was graciously pleased to
approve of the regiment being styled the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span>,
or the <span class="fs70">BEDFORDSHIRE</span>, instead of the <em>Buckinghamshire</em>,
Regiment: this exchange of County titles took place
with the Fourteenth Regiment of Foot.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1810</div>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Henry Tolley assumed the command
of the regiment, in June, 1810.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811<br />1812</div>

<p>During its stay at Surinam and Barbadoes, the
regiment lost twenty-seven officers and upwards of five
hundred men by disease. The survivors returned to
England by detachments in 1810, 1811, and 1812, and
landed at Falmouth and Portsmouth. One ship, the
"Islam," having on board the remainder of the grenadiers
and of one battalion company, was wrecked on the
Tuscan Rock off the coast of Ireland. By the exertions of
some workmen, who were making preparations to erect
a lighthouse on the rock, all were saved excepting one
man, one woman, and some children; all the arms,
appointments, and baggage were lost. On the following
day the party was taken off the rock by a brig,
and conveyed to Beaumaris in Wales.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>After occupying quarters at various stations, and
receiving many volunteers from the English and Irish
militia, the regiment marched to Sunderland in July;
and in March, 1813, embarked from thence for Perth:
in July of this year it proceeded to Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>Sir Charles Green, Baronet, was removed to the
Thirty-seventh regiment in February, 1814, when
His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, conferred
the colonelcy of the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> on Lieut.-General
Sir George Prevost, from the Seventy-sixth regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>During this period the war was continued in Europe,
and British troops were acquiring laurels under the
Duke of Wellington: at the same time the measures pursued
to counteract the decrees made by Napoleon, Emperor
of the French, for the destruction of the commerce
of Great Britain, brought on a war between the British
Crown and the United States of North America; and
in the spring of this year the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> embarked
from Monkstown to join the British troops in Canada.
The regiment was commanded by Colonel Tolley, and
arriving at Quebec on the 29th of May, was stationed
a short period at that fortress; it was afterwards
removed to Chambly, from whence it proceeded to
Montreal. The British troops having failed in the
attack of the American post at Plattsburg, the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span>
were relieved from duty at Montreal, sent to
the upper province, and stationed at Fort Wellington.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>A treaty of peace having been concluded with the
Americans, the regiment was ordered to return to
Europe; it sailed from Quebec in July, and arrived at
Portsmouth in August. The return of Buonaparte to
France,&mdash;his reassumption of the imperial dignity,&mdash;his
overthrow at Waterloo, and surrender to a British
man-of-war, had occurred while the regiment was in
Canada, and on the passage to Europe; on its arrival
at Portsmouth, it was ordered to proceed to the Continent,
to join the army commanded by the Duke of
Wellington. The regiment landed at Ostend, and
marching to Paris, encamped at St. Denis.</p>

<p>On the conclusion of the definitive treaties of peace,
the regiment marched to Calais, where it embarked
for England, and landing at Dover, remained there
fourteen days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir George Prevost, Baronet, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
died, the Prince Regent nominated Major-General
Hugh Mackay Gordon to the colonelcy of the regiment,
from the York Chasseurs, by commission dated the 8th
of January, 1816.</p>

<p>From Dover the regiment embarked for Ireland; it
landed at Monkstown on the 3rd of February, and was
stationed successively at Fermoy, Limerick, and Cashel.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1817<br />1818</div>

<p>In 1817 the regiment was removed to Kilkenny;
and in 1818 to Athlone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819<br />1820</div>

<p>On the 25th of August, 1819, the regiment embarked
from Cork, under the command of Colonel Tolley, for
colonial service, and touching at the Cape of Good
Hope, the flank companies landed, and remained at
Cape Town a month. The battalion companies continued
their voyage to Ceylon, and landed at Colombo
on the 20th of February, 1820, under Major William
Vandeleur. The flank companies, under Colonel Tolley,
arrived in March.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821<br />1822</div>

<p>The regiment remained seventeen months at Colombo,
where it was joined by one hundred and twenty-eight
volunteers from the Seventy-third; in August, 1821, it
marched, under Major Vandeleur, for Kandy, where
Colonel Tolley resumed the command, and on his
proceeding on leave of absence, in October, 1822, the
command devolved on Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Lionel
Hook.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1823</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Gordon died in the spring of 1823,
and was succeeded in the colonelcy by Lieut.-General
William Carr, Viscount Beresford, G.C.B., and G.C.H.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824</div>

<p>In March, 1824, the regiment returned to Colombo,
where it lost several officers and a number of men by a
malignant fever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825<br />1826</div>

<p>Colonel Tolley was promoted to the rank of Major-General;
Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Hook was nominated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to a Lieut.-Colonelcy in the Ceylon rifle corps; and
Colonel David Ximenes was appointed Lieut.-Colonel
of the <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span>; this officer arrived at Colombo in
March, 1826, and assumed the command of the
regiment, which marched from Colombo, in July following,
for Point de Galle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1827</div>

<p>On the 2nd of July, 1827, Lieutenants Alexander,
Mylius, and Hyde, Ensigns Cassidi and Hannagan,
three serjeants, and one hundred and eight rank and
file, joined from the depôt in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1828<br />1829</div>

<p>The regiment, having been appointed to proceed to
Bengal, was relieved from duty at the island of Ceylon,
by the Sixty-first, in November, 1828, and embarking
from thence in four divisions, arrived at Calcutta in
January, 1829, when Colonel Ximenes was appointed
to command the garrison of Fort William, and Major
John W. Adain assumed the command of the regiment;
which received one hundred and fourteen volunteers
from the Fifty-ninth, and forty-six from the Thirtieth
and Forty-seventh regiments. In April Major Adain
obtained leave to proceed to England, and the command
of the regiment devolved on Major Adam Gordon
Campbell, until the arrival of Lieut.-Colonel Lionel
Smith Hook, in November: this officer was appointed
to the regiment in February of this year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1830</div>

<p>The <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span> remained on duty at Calcutta, where,
in October and November, 1830, they received sixty-four
volunteers from other corps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1831</div>

<p>In January, 1831, Colonel Hook was nominated to
the command of the garrison of Fort William, and
Major Campbell resumed the command; but on the
regiment quitting Calcutta, in March following, to
proceed in steam-boats to Chinsurah, Colonel Hook
again assumed the command. At this period twenty
volunteers joined from the Royal regiment.</p>

until December, 1833, when it commenced its march
for Ghazepore: while on the march its destination was
altered for Cawnpore; and on the 7th of February,
1834, it had the misfortune to lose its commanding
officer, Colonel Hook, who died at the camp at Secrole,
Benares, when the command again devolved on Major
Campbell: on the 28th of February the regiment
arrived at Cawnpore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1835<br />1836</div>

<p>In March, 1835, Captain H. M<sup>c</sup>Manus, Ensigns Henry

Another detachment joined in May; and in March,
1836, one hundred and six volunteers were received
from the Thirty-eighth regiment,&mdash;also eighty-four
recruits from England, under Captain R. Brown,
Ensigns Hook and Lawson, and Surgeon Steele. They
were followed by Ensigns G. M. Ross and H. C. M.
Ximenes, in September.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1837<br />1838</div>

<p>In March, 1837, Lieutenant Gibbs, and thirty-two

<div class="sidenote">1839<br />1840</div>

<p>On the 24th of December, 1839, the regiment received
orders to proceed by water to Calcutta; but in January,
1840, it received orders to disembark at Dinapore, and
relieve the Forty-ninth regiment, under orders to proceed
with the expedition to China. The <span class="fs70">SIXTEENTH</span>
remained at Dinapore until October, when they were
relieved by a wing of the Twenty-first fusiliers, and
embarked for the Presidency, where they arrived on
the 4th of November.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1841</div>

<p>Orders having been issued for the regiment to return
to England, it transferred a number of volunteers to
other corps, and embarked, in three divisions, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
December, 1840, and January, 1841, under Lieut.-Colonel
Campbell, Major H. Clements, and Brevet-Major
Dalzell; and landing at Gravesend in April following,
marched from thence to Canterbury, from whence four
companies were afterwards detached to Dover.</p>

<p>In August the regiment was supplied with new
<em>Percussion Arms</em>. In December it marched to London,
and proceeded from thence by railway to Winchester.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1842</div>

<p>Leaving Winchester in April, 1842, the regiment
proceeded by railway to Gosport, and in August it was
removed to Portsmouth.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of September <span class="fs70">NEW COLOURS</span> were presented
to the regiment, on Southsea Common, by the

the regiment was afterwards addressed by Major-General
the Honorable <span class="smcap">Sir Hercules R. Pakenham</span>,
K.C.B., commanding the South-west District, who
detailed, in a very impressive manner, the ancient
achievements of the corps. A large assemblage of
nobility and gentry were present at the ceremony, and
were afterwards entertained by the officers at a déjeuné
and ball.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1843</div>

<p>The regiment proceeded from Portsmouth to Manchester,
in May, 1843, and from thence to Ireland in
July. During the remainder of the year it was
stationed at Newbridge and Birr.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1844</div>

<p>From Birr the regiment marched, in February, 1844,
to Naas, and in March removed to Dublin, where it

has been on the British establishment. He was captain of
one of the companies of the Royal regiment sent to the relief
of Tangier, in Africa, when that fortress was besieged by the
Moors in 1680, and he was wounded in the general engagement
on the 27th of September, 1680, when the Moorish
army was overthrown. He was subsequently promoted to
the lieutenant-colonelcy of his regiment; and he commanded
the companies of his corps at the battle of Sedgemoor, on the

James II. placed great confidence in the loyalty of Colonel
Douglas, and when His Majesty's power was menaced by the
armament under the Prince of Orange, the King nominated
this distinguished Scots officer to raise a regiment, now the
<span class="smcap">Sixteenth</span> foot, of which he was appointed colonel. At the

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
